# OpenGL Empty Template Project
A public repo to help more easily set up C++ OpenGL Projects (VS-2022, GLFW, GLEW and GLM)

This project was created using VS-2022 (Build tools version 143). If using a different version of Visual Studio, simply change the build tools versions of the C++ project to that of the Visual Studio version you are using.
